# Computer Vision for Image Analysis

In this repository you will find instructions on how to build your own image processing/computer vision library from (mostly) scratch. The work is divided out into different assignments, found in the `src/` directory.

To get started, make sure you have `git`, a C compiler, and `make` installed.
