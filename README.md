# Comupter Vision for Image Analysis

In this repository you will find instructions on how to build your own image processing/computer vision library from (mostly) scratch. The work is divided out into different assignments, found in the `src/` directory.

To get started, make sure you have `git`, a C compiler, and `make` installed.

## Tasks

1) Image Processing to understand how to manipulate pixels.

2) Convolutions and Filters

3) Stitching Panorama Images using descriptors

4) Implementing neural networks.

5) CNNs

6) Optical Flow for motion analysis
